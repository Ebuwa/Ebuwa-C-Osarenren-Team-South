My name is Ebuwa Chimere Osarenren. 

I am a UX Reseacher currently taking advantage of the COVID-19 outbreak by training in a Quality Assurance Analyst online course. 


I have a Bachelors and Masters in International Relations and Political Science. 

I find automated testing more tasking than manual testing.
